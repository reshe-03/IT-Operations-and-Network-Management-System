Introduction
This document outlines the architecture, analysis algorithms, and user interface design for an AI-driven IT operations and network management system. The system is designed to:

Anticipate and resolve IT issues using predictive analytics (AIOps).
Optimize resource utilization and lifecycle management through automated IT asset management.
Ensure reliable connectivity and performance via AI-powered network monitoring and management.
Platform Architecture
System Overview
The platform consists of several interconnected components:

Data Ingestion Layer: Collects and preprocesses data from various IT and network systems.
Predictive Analytics Engine: Uses machine learning models to predict IT issues and network failures.
Management Dashboard: Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing IT operations and network performance.
Components
Data Ingestion Layer
Sources: IT system logs, network monitoring tools, asset management databases.
Processing: Data cleansing, normalization, and feature extraction.
Predictive Analytics Engine
Model: Deep Learning model (CNN) trained on historical IT and network data.
Features: CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network usage, issue.
